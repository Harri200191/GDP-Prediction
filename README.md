# GDP Prediction using ANN with ARIMA

This project aims to predict the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the next decade of a country using a combination of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. The project utilizes historical GDP data and combines the strengths of both ANN and ARIMA to generate accurate and reliable predictions.

## Introduction

Predicting GDP is a complex task due to various factors that influence economic growth. This project utilizes a hybrid approach by combining the ANN and ARIMA models to leverage their respective strengths. ANN is capable of learning complex relationships between input features and the target variable, while ARIMA is effective in capturing temporal dependencies and trends.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
